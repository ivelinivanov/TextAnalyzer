After weeks of speculation and a rumored launch next week, the company has just mailed out invitations to an event in Cupertino at Apple's campus on September 10th starting at 10AM PT. The Verge will be there covering the event live, with minute-by-minute updates on everything and anything announced.
Months of rumors point towards two new iPhones this year: an iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. If the leaks and rumors are accurate, then the iPhone 5S may feature a fingerprint sensor for device security, a 12- or 13-megapixel camera with dual-LED flash, and a gold-colored variant. The next traditional iPhone flagship device looks like it will retain a similar design to the existing iPhone 5. The big surprise at next week's event could be an entirely new iPhone 5C device. Rumored as a plastic low-cost option available in multiple colors, a number of leaks have suggested it will be branded iPhone 5C with the C presumably standing for color. Any new iPad additions are expected to launch at a separate event, similar to how Apple introduced the iPad mini last year.

Aside from new iPhone hardware, Apple is also preparing its "biggest change" yet: a major UI overhaul to its iOS software. iOS 7 has been in beta for months, but it's likely that Apple will have some surprise additions on the software side that take advantage of the new iPhone hardware. Existing iPhone users will also be waiting to hear when the final version of iOS 7 will be made available.

Regardless of what Apple decides to unveil, The Verge will be in Cupertino on the 10th at 10AM PT — so tune in on the day of the event so you can follow our live blog for every piece of news as it happens.Apple is ready to unveil its next-generation iPhone hardware on September 10th.

Aside from new iPhone hardware, Apple is also preparing its "biggest change" yet: a major UI overhaul to its iOS software. iOS 7 has been in beta for months, but it's likely that Apple will have some surprise additions on the software side that take advantage of the new iPhone hardware. Existing iPhone users will also be waiting to hear when the final version of iOS 7 will be made available.

Regardless of what Apple decides to unveil, The Verge will be in Cupertino on the 10th at 10AM PT — so tune in on the day of the event so you can follow our live blog for every piece of news as it happens.Apple is ready to unveil its next-generation iPhone hardware on September 10th. After weeks of speculation and a rumored launch next week, the company has just mailed out invitations to an event in Cupertino at Apple's campus on September 10th starting at 10AM PT. The Verge will be there covering the event live, with minute-by-minute updates on everything and anything announced.
Months of rumors point towards two new iPhones this year: an iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. If the leaks and rumors are accurate, then the iPhone 5S may feature a fingerprint sensor for device security, a 12- or 13-megapixel camera with dual-LED flash, and a gold-colored variant. The next traditional iPhone flagship device looks like it will retain a similar design to the existing iPhone 5. The big surprise at next week's event could be an entirely new iPhone 5C device. Rumored as a plastic low-cost option available in multiple colors, a number of leaks have suggested it will be branded iPhone 5C with the C presumably standing for color. Any new iPad additions are expected to launch at a separate event, similar to how Apple introduced the iPad mini last year.
